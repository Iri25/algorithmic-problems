# algorithmic-problems

The project contains the efficient solution of some algorithmic problems in terms of complexity (temporal and spatial).

The list of problems is:
1. Determine the last (alphabetical) word that can appear in a text containing multiple words separated by " " (space). `For example. the last (alphabetical) word in "Ana has red and yellow apples" is the word "si".`
2. Determine the Euclidean distance between two locations identified by pairs of numbers. `For example. the distance between (1,5) and (4,1) is 5.0.`
3. Determine the dot product of two sparse vectors containing real numbers. A vector is sparse when it contains many null elements. Vectors can have any size. `For example. dot product of 2 one-dimensional vectors [1,0,2,0,3] and [1,2,0,3,1] is 4.`
4. Determine the words of a text that appear exactly once in that text. `For example. the words that appear only once in "ana has ana has apples tomatoes ana" are: 'apples' and 'tomatoes'.`
